# Neutral Gray UI

A gray UI theme for Atom. This theme is lighter than most of the dark themes and is easy to read. The goal was to make a theme that was easy to read no matter the users environment.

This theme will complement to whatever syntax theme use.

This theme was designed to work best with [Atom Darcula Syntax](https://atom.io/packages/darcula-syntax).
